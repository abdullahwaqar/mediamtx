## Introduction

The point of interest and new addition to the MediaMTX project is the folder:

```
internal/servers/beacon_stream
```

This directory includes the server implementation for GPS data streaming that communicates using WebRTC and utilizes WebSockets for signaling.

## Server Implementation

The server implementation is designed to handle GPS data streaming through various protocols. It communicates using WebRTC for media transmission and WebSockets for signaling.

### Broadcasters

Within the `internal/servers/beacon_stream` folder, there are three broadcasters:

- **`broadcastGPSDataByWebsocket`**
- **`broadcastGPSDataByTCP`**
- **`broadcastGPSDataByUDP`**

As the names suggest, each broadcaster connects to the respective server type dictated by the configuration:

- **WebSocket**: Uses WebSockets to receive GPS data.
- **TCP**: Connects to a TCP server for GPS data.
- **UDP**: Connects to a UDP server for GPS data.

These broadcasters are controlled via the configuration file and are responsible for receiving GPS data from the specified server and protocol.

## Configuration

The GPS server functionality is configurable through the `mediamtx.yml` file. The configuration determines whether the GPS server is active and specifies the connection details.

If the `gpsConfig` key is absent in the configuration file, the GPS server will not be active, and MediaMTX will function as the default server without the extended GPS capability.

### GPS Configuration Example

Below is an example of the GPS configuration section in `mediamtx.yml`:

```yaml
###############################################
# GPS Configuration
# This holds the protocol, IP address, and port of the server that needs to connect to get the GPS data stream.
# The protocol dictates the type of server to connect to for the data stream that will be sent over the data channel.

gpsConfig:
  # Can be 'ws' (WebSocket), 'tcp', or 'udp'
  protocol: udp

  # Specify the server's IP address to connect to
  ipAddress: 0.0.0.0

  # Port number of the server
  port: 13370
```

- **`protocol`**: Specifies the protocol to use (`ws`, `tcp`, or `udp`).
- **`ipAddress`**: The IP address of the GPS data server.
- **`port`**: The port number of the GPS data server.

## Client-Side Implementation

The client-side implementation can be found in:

```
internal/servers/webrtc/read_index.html
```

A new script has been added to this HTML file that:

- Establishes a peer connection.
- Opens a data channel named **"gps"**.
- Renders the GPS output data on the client side.

The script is written in plain JavaScript.

**Note**: If you make any changes to this HTML file, you will need to rebuild the binary since MediaMTX includes this file in the binary and serves it directly from memory.

## Building and Running

### Using Docker

To compile the binaries for all supported platforms, you need to have Docker installed. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make binaries
```

This command will create the binaries using Docker.

### For Development

For development purposes, you need to have the latest version of Go installed on your system. You can build and run MediaMTX by executing:

```bash
go build -o mediamtx . && ./mediamtx
```

This command builds the `mediamtx` binary and runs it.

## Important Notes

- **Rebuilding After HTML Changes**: If you modify the `read_index.html` file, you must rebuild the binary. MediaMTX embeds this file into the binary and serves it directly from memory.
- **Configuration Absence**: Without the `gpsConfig` key in `mediamtx.yml`, the GPS server features will be inactive, and MediaMTX will operate with its default capabilities.

### Brief Architecture

Modified MediaMTX by adding a **separate data channel** for transmitting GPS data, as MediaMTX typically only handles media streams (audio/video). In a WebRTC context, media streams require specific metadata, codec information, and a more complex handshake process to handle the transmission.

Since GPS data doesnâ€™t need this level of complexity, and WebRTC channels are designed to handle distinct types of data, creating a dedicated data channel, kept the media and GPS data transmission separate, ensuring each type of data is handled appropriately without interfering with the other.

### 1. **Integration of WebRTC with a Separate Data Channel:**

- Leveraged **Pion WebRTC**, which is already included as a dependency in MediaMTX, to create a separate WebRTC **data channel**.
- This data channel is solely responsible for transmitting **GPS data** (yaw, pitch, roll, timestamp, and accuracy) to connected clients. It operates in parallel with the media channels, ensuring the system continues handling media while also allowing GPS data transmission.

### 2. **Non-blocking Server Setup:**

- The WebRTC server is created in a separate **Go routine**, ensuring that it runs in a **non-blocking** fashion. The GPS broadcasting server only starts if the appropriate GPS configuration is present (such as protocol, IP address, and port).
- This ensures that the GPS data channel does not interfere with the media streaming processes, keeping the system's core media-handling capabilities intact while extending its functionality.

### 3. **Simple Signaling Mechanism:**

- Kept the signaling mechanism as simple as possible to maintain a balance between functionality and complexity. WebRTC signaling is managed via **WebSocket**, handling **SDP offers**, **ICE candidates**, and peer connection establishment with minimal overhead.
- I used **WebSocket** for handling the signaling and managing WebRTC connection requests. Once the client sends an SDP offer, the server responds with an SDP answer, setting up the WebRTC connection.

### 4. **Data Channel Handling:**

- Once the WebRTC connection is established, I create a **data channel** with the label `"data"`. This channel is dedicated to sending GPS data, completely separate from the media streams.
- When the data channel opens, the server begins transmitting the GPS data. Made sure this process only starts **once** per connection to avoid redundant broadcasting and potential issues with multiple broadcast loops.

### 5. **Protocol-Specific GPS Broadcasting:**

- Depending on the GPS configuration, the server connects to external sources to retrieve GPS data using the protocol specified (WebSocket, TCP, or UDP).
  - **WebSocket:** The function `broadcastGPSDataByWebsocket` connects to an external WebSocket server and listens for GPS data to broadcast to WebRTC clients.
  - **TCP/UDP:** Similarly, `broadcastGPSDataByTCP` and `broadcastGPSDataByUDP` handle connections to TCP/UDP servers, read GPS data, and transmit it over the data channels.
- The GPS data is stored in the **GPSData** structure, which holds the values (yaw, pitch, roll), timestamp, and accuracy, and is transmitted to all connected WebRTC clients.

### 6. **Simple Synchronization and Concurrency:**

- To ensure smooth concurrent access to shared resources, used **sync.Mutex** for managing access to the data channels. The data channels are stored in a slice, and methods like `addDataChannel` and `removeDataChannel` ensure thread-safe modifications.
- Additionally, a **sync.Once** ensures that the GPS broadcasting logic is only initiated once for each session, keeping things simple and avoiding multiple unnecessary connections.

### 7. **Focus on Simplicity:**

- Throughout the modification process, made a conscious effort to keep the architecture **simple**. For example, I avoided adding unnecessary complexity in the signaling process and kept the configuration-driven GPS broadcasting flexible yet minimal.
- The WebRTC server and data broadcasting functions operate independently of the media transmission functions, ensuring that the core MediaMTX functionality remains unchanged while enabling seamless GPS data streaming.

### Key Aspects

- **Separation of concerns**: The data channel is isolated from the media streaming functionality, ensuring that the media transmission (audio/video) remains unaffected.
- **Protocol flexibility**: GPS data can be transmitted over WebSocket, TCP, or UDP, depending on the configuration.
- **Concurrency and simplicity**: I ensured non-blocking operation with simple synchronization techniques to keep the system lightweight and efficient.
